# Creative Disturbance

### About the Project

	Creative Disturbance is an international podcast-driven collaboration platform for the art, science and technology community. Using crowdsourcing and collaborative filtering, Creative Disturbance identifies emerging topics and the passionate communities driving them. As a product of this linking, unlikely connections emerge within the community in the form of multi-lingual podcasts to discuss, expand upon, collaborate within, and more deeply connect “disturbing” ideas and projects.

	Creative Disturbance, currently in a test-bed prototype with an organisational node at The University of Texas at Dallas, managed from the Leonardo Initiatives of ArtSciLab of the Arts and Technology program, operated by faculty, students and research fellows, and sustained through crowdfunding and membership subscriptions.
